## Cryptocurrency Investment Portfolio Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to generate a classification report of tradable cryptocurrencies for investment bank Accountability Accounting. We accomplished this by preprocessing the raw data to allow us to use an unsupervised learning model and principal component analysis to assign each cryptocurrency to a cluster or class. The classification clusters for each currency can be seen visualized on a plot of the final scaled data coded by color.
